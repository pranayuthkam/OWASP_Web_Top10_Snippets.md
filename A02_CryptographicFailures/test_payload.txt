Vulnerable Behavior:
- Inspect localStorage â†’ token is easily decodable using base64 decode
- Decode: atob(localStorage.getItem('token'))

Fixed Behavior:
- Encrypted data is not human-readable or reversible without the key and IV
- Test with: localStorage.getItem('ciphertext') (will be random binary string)
